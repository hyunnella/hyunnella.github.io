		<h1>Who or What is Stray Kids ?</h1>
		<p>Stray Kids was formed in 2017 by undergoing a reality show produced by the Entertaintment Group JYP. Ultimately Stray Kids has grouped eight (8) gifted boys. Their names are: Bang Chan, Changbin, Han, Lee Know, Hyunjin, Seungmin, Felix & I.N. They are part of the 4th generation (commonly called "4th gen" by Kpop fans) and have already taken a spot for themselves through their dedicated and assiduous labor to produce quality songs for their fans. Talking about fans, theirs are called "Stays". On a personal note, these young boys aren't "idols", they are "inspiration" to go beyong you believe yourselves incapable to. They are more families from another continent and different parents. I cherished them particularly. </p>

	<br><p>I could take paragraphs and paragraphs to introduce him to you yet none of these words would be sufficient to fully grasp who he is. Regarding those reasons, i chose to present him through videos.</p>

	<h1>Hwang Hyunjin</h1>
	<p>Hyunjin from his full name Hwang Hyunjin is a South Korean born in March 20th 2000. He was scouted by JYP and became a trainee. Into the bargain, he particiapted in JYP's tv show and ended up forming a group with 7 other members. He became well-known as a dancer who rightfully expresses his feelings while dancing. His cover of "Psycho" did a worldwild tour. He is not only a dancer but also a singer and rapper.
	His personality can be defined as sassy and dramatic. His exagerated expressions made people like him even more since it was the real him. He does not impersonate somebody, Hyunjin is himself and that's what make him so unique in the K-pop universe. Hwang Hyunjin profundly loves his fans that he instigated the <span>"#lovestay"</span> to demonstrate how deep is his love towards us.</p>
